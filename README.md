# bottle-water-chew-toys
(not serious) nah nah cuz what if we make it a thing where we make it normal for people over the age of 3 normal to bite stuff?? and what if we made something that is like the material and shape of a water bottle but we make it in a way that is made for chewing? what if we made a bottle of water be able to be drank from but also be able to chew from !! this would make it much easier for people like me who are obsessed with chewing stuff to enjoy something to bite (I know people in real life who also have this problem) (not srs PLEASE dont take this serious!! (only the making chewing stuff normal part should be taken seriously) )
